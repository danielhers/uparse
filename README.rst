``uparse`` is a shift-reduce parser for discontinuous structures. It has been developed at the project *Grammar Formalisms beyond Context-Free Grammars and their use for Machine Learning Tasks* at the Department for Computational Linguistics at the Institute for Language and Information at the University of DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany (see http://phil.hhu.de/beyond-cfg). The project is sponsored by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG).

Quick Start
===========

To build the parser, you need at least Java 8 and Apache ant 1.8 or higher. An ant build file is included, the default target of which builds a jar file in the project root. All necessary dependencies are pulled automatically. To run the parser, first generate a parameter file using ``java -jar uparse.jar -generate``. The generated file ``parameters`` contains all available options, set to their default values. Each option is documented. The parser is run by passing it the path to the parameter file, i.e., using ``java -jar uparse.jar parameters``.
